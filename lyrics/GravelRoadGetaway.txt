GRAVEL ROAD GETAWAY

You polish your nails, I polish my truck
Wiping it down while youâ€™re getting dolled up
My big eyed dough, waiting for her buck
To take her on the town

I pull in your drive, acting so smooth
Like James Dean from some old black and white movie
You smile so sweet, got me thinking it's true
You slide in and we roll out

You and me and my old truck
Good piece of chain so we don't get stuck
We'll ride around till the moon shows up and then just slip away
Where nobody knows on a gravel road getaway

We stop off at Chuck's to have us a few
A Miller for me and a Merlo for you
Twirl you around a time or two
Together on the floor

Buzz kickin' in and I'm feeling alright
You shoot me that wink and I got the green light
We're both young and so is the night
And we know what the moonlight's for

You and me and my old truck
Good piece of chain so we don't get stuck
We'll ride around till the moon shows up and then just slip away
Where nobody knows on a gravel road getaway

We've got some windows to steam up
We've got some night moves to get right
Baby, nothing I could dream of is prettier than you wearing nothing but the moonlight

You and me and my old truck
Good piece of chain so we don't get stuck
We'll ride around till the moon shows up and then just slip away
Where nobody knows on a gravel road getaway
