SOUTHERLY FLOW

Rollin’ with the windows down, sun on my face
My Silverado laid out ripping through the haze
Boots on the dash, girl, you’re stealin’ the show
We’re skimmin’ like villains with that Southerly flow

Bonfire nights and a backbeat groove
A little dirt road rhythm got me movin’ with you

Got that Southerly flow, slow and steady, let it ride
Can’t stop the ocean when you’re rolling with the tide
From the backwoods heat to the city lights glow
I keep it down-home cool with that Southerly flow
Yeah, that Southerly flow

Snapback tilted, got a rhyme’ll make ya jump jump
Mix a little twang with the bass goin’ thump thump
Girl, your laugh’s like a song on the radio
Spinnin’ on repeat with a Southerly flow
 
Bonfire nights and a backbeat groove
A little dirt road rhythm got me movin’ with you

Got that Southerly flow, slow and steady, let it ride
Can’t stop the ocean when you’re rolling with the tide
From the backwoods heat to the city lights glow
I keep it down-home cool with that Southerly flow
Yeah, that Southerly flow

Trucks kickin’ dust, bass hittin’ low
Country boy swagger with a hip-hop glow
Boots hit the ground, and the whole crowd know
Ain’t no stoppin’ this Southerly flow

Got that Southerly flow, slow and steady, let it ride
Can’t stop the ocean when you’re rolling with the tide
From the backwoods heat to the city lights glow
I keep it down-home cool with that Southerly flow
Yeah, that Southerly flow

Yeah, I keep it rollin’, keep it rollin’ slow
Livin’ my life in that Southerly flow
