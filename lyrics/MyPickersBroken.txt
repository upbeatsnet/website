MY PICKER'S BROKEN

Met a blue-eyed dream in a neon bar
He said all the right things, took it way too far
Now I’m staring at my ceiling at 2 AM
Wonderin’ why I let ‘em in again

My mama says I fall too fast
My best friend says I pick ‘em bad
Every time I think I’ve found the one
Is right about the time it’s over and done
 
My picker’s broken, can’t get it right
Keep picking wrong hearts every Friday night
Fallin’ for the lines and the cowboy charm
When I should be waitin’ on a steady arm
Yeah, my picker’s broken, and it’s plain to see
Love ain’t been too kind to me
Is it wrong for me to keep on hopin’
When my picker’s broken

Met a rambling man with a song to sing
Just another free bird with a broken wing
It’s like I’m drawn to a heartbreak sign
Won’t somebody fix this heart of mine

Every time I think I’ve learned my lesson
I jump heartfirst without a question
Swear I’m done with the bad ones now
But how can I stop when I can’t slow down

My picker’s broken, can’t get it right
Keep picking wrong hearts every Friday night
Fallin’ for the lines and the cowboy charm
When I should be waitin’ on a steady arm
Yeah, my picker’s broken, and it’s plain to see
Love ain’t been too kind to me
Is it wrong for me to keep on hopin’
When my picker’s broken

Maybe I should put this heart on hold
Stop diving in,, take back control
But I know me, and I know this
I still believe in the magic of that first kiss

My picker’s broken, but I still try
One of these days, I’ll get it right
Find me a love that’s the real thing
Then I’ll stop sleeping with broken dreams
Yeah, my picker’s broken, but my heart’s still right
For the right one on the right night
‘Til then, I’ll keep my hope wide open
Even if my picker’s broken
