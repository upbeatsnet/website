WHAT BUBBA'S COOKIN'

There's an old dirt road way back in the woods
So far back where no one goes
The county cops or the state police
Will never be found down Cooker Road
So don't be a fool and get caught lookin'
If you ain't buyin' what Bubba's cookin' (yeah)

He's got an old mobile home 'cause Bubba ain't fussy
And propane tanks all over the yard
And boxes of draino and Robotussin
Cause gettin' what he needs ain't really that hard
Don't be a fool and get caught lookin'
If you ain't buyin' what Bubba's cookin' (Yeah! Cook it down!)

The family recipe’s a close guarded secret
Something he got from a stretch in the pin
Gettin’ caught’s just an inconvenience
Cause soon he’ll be out and cooking again
Don't be a fool and get caught lookin'
If you ain't buyin' what Bubba's cookin' (yeah)

Don't be a fool and get caught lookin'
If you ain't buyin' what Bubba's cookin' (yeah)
Yeahhhhhhhhhh!
