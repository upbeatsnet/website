LITTLE BIT OF LOVE

“Good for nothing” was something people used to say about me
I wasn’t much till a touch from the right hand set me free
Seeing me through her eyes was a moment of clarity
I never knew who I was till I saw who I wanted to be.

She’s got me churchin’ on Sunday
Working on Monday
Everybody’s wondering where the old me’s run off to
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do

I can’t remember where I parked my car
My mind keeps working overtime thinking ‘bout her tender heart
What started with a tiny spark’s turned into a pretty big deal
Now I’m finding my wings, thinking ‘bout rings 
And wondering if forever is real

She’s got me churchin’ on Sunday
Working on Monday
Everybody’s wondering where the old me’s run off to
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do

I used to be lazy
Unpredictable and crazy
Something’s got ahold of me 
And I’m turning out to be
Like my momma raised me [Stop]

She’s got me churchin’ on Sunday
Working on Monday
Everybody’s wondering where the old me’s run off to
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do

Yea,she’s got me churchin’ on Sunday
Working on Monday
Everybody’s wondering where the old me’s run off to
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do
Don’t be surprised what a little bit of love can do
