WALKING THAT COUNTRY MILE

Sun’s dipping down below the pines
Boots on gravel, takin’ my time
Dust on the wind, smell of fresh-cut hay
Ain’t nothin’ here I’d ever trade away

Every step I take, I’m where I belong
This old dirt road’s always been my home

Walkin’ that country mile
Past fields and fences chasing firefly light
Ponds I ain't fished, hills I ain't climbed
My heart stays beating on backroad time
Walkin’ that country mile
Walkin’ that country mile

Corn rows rustle in the evening breeze
Like a whisper, soothing my soul
Cool creek water on a midnight dare, river’s calling
The moonlight grabs you till you can’t let go

It’s not how fast you get where you’re goin’
It’s all ‘bout the seeds you're sowin’

Walkin’ that country mile
Past fields and fences chasing firefly light
Ponds I ain't fished, hills I ain't climbed
My heart stays beating on backroad time
Walkin’ that country mile
Walkin’ that country mile

Some folks rush through and never see
The way the sunset paints the sky for free
But I’ll take the long way in dirtroad style
When you’re walkin’ that country mile

Walkin’ that country mile
Past fields and fences chasing firefly light
Ponds I ain't fished and hills I ain't climbed
My heart stays beating on backroad time
Walkin’ that country mile
Walkin’ that country mile

With the cool night air and the sky on fire
I’ll keep walkin’ that country mile
