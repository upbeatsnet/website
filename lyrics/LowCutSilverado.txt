LOW CUT SILVERADO

Low profile flat black tires, accents of polished steel
You can't take your eyes off my shiny spinner wheels
Rolling with the storm like a Panhandle Tornado
As I cruise through town in my low cut Silverado

I'm not too much on romance, or matters of the soul
I live to pimp my ride mama, and that's just the way I roll
But you'd drop your Casanova, for this dirt road desperado
And a chance to ride in my low cut Silverado

I roll through town with my windows down, got my woofers woofin'
You can't help but lookin' cause I'm 
Rollin' thunder and I'm ridin' fat
Behind the wheel pretty baby, it's where it's at

Me and the boys just cruisin', not in the mood for trouble
But if you get in our grill, you'll get an old school rumble
You best stay out of our way and our backroad bravado
As we take this town in my low cut Silverado

I roll through town with my windows down, got my woofers woofin'
You can't help but lookin' cause I'm 
Rollin' thunder and I'm ridin' fat
Behind the wheel pretty baby, it's where it's at

Climb up in the cab pretty baby, strap in and hold on tight
I got the neon gleaming and I'm riding on a beam of light
You best get over yourself, I’ll keep it on the down-low
What happens in the backseat of my low-cut Silverado.

I roll through town with my windows down, got my woofers woofin'
You can't help but lookin' cause I'm 
Rollin' thunder and I'm ridin' fat
Behind the wheel pretty baby, it's where it's at

Ride with me and you’ll cast a big long shadow
As we roll up to the club in my low-cut Silverado
