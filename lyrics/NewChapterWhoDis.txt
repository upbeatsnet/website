NEW CHAPTER - WHO DIS?

Packed up my heart, put it in the back of my truck
Drove past your house, didn’t even give a fu…(laughs)
Boots on the dash, hair blowing in the wind
It’s  on to the next ONE , I’m ready to begin

You thought I’d be cryin’, thought I’d be blue
But I’m already smiling at someone new

New chapter, who dis? I’m turnin’ the page
Dancin’ in the headlights I’m center stage
Heartbreak behind me, ain’t taking no shiz
Say goodbye, baby, new chapter, who dis?

Met a cowboy with a grin and a guitar
Said, “Darlin’, hop in, let’s chase the stars”
The past’s getting lighter , it don’t weigh a thing
It’s time for the fireworks,  come on!  Let’s sing!

You thought you had me, you thought I’d stay
But I’m livin’ my story in a whole new way

New chapter, who dis? I’m turnin’ the page
Dancin’ in the headlights, I’m center stage
Heartbreak behind me,  ain’t taking no shiz
Say goodbye, baby, new chapter, who dis?

No calls, no texts, no wasted time
I’m the au thor now, this life’s all mine
So if you’re peekin’ back, don’t even try
I’m too busy reachin’ for the sky

New chapter, who dis? I’m turnin’ the page
Dancin’ in the headlights, I’m center stage
Heartbreak behind me,  ain’t taking no shiz
Say goodbye, baby, new chapter, who dis?
Yeah, new chapter, who dis
