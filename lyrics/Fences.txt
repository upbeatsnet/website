FENCES

We started out wide open, nothing in the way
Every word was easy, every night was safe
But somewhere in the middle, cracks began to show
I reach for your hand, but it’s too far away to hold

We built these walls without knowing why
Little lies let the silence grow higher
I wanna break them down tonight
But we can’t climb if we don’t try

Fences, standing where our love should be
Every time I run to you you’re miles from me
And I can’t tear ‘em down alone
Am I fighting on my own?
Fences, words cut just like barbed wire
Every kiss tosses on the fire
And I don’t wanna live like this
On opposite sides of fences

We’re talking in circles, pretending that we’re fine
What happened to the lightning that once was in our eyes
It’s hard to find the future when so much past still remains
And every step forward just pulls us away

We built these walls without knowing why
Little lies let the silence grow higher
I wanna break them down tonight
But we can’t climb if we don’t try

Fences, standing where our love should be
I run to you but you’re miles from me
And I can’t tear ‘em down alone
Feels like I’m fighting on my own
Fences, words cut just like barbed wire
Every kiss tosses water on the fire
And I don’t wanna live like this
On opposite sides of fences

Maybe if we let the pieces fall
We could start again without these walls
But it’s hard when we both pretend
That broken fences never mend

Fences, standing where our love should be
I run to you but you’re miles from me
And I can’t tear ‘em down alone
Feels like I’m fighting on my own
Fences, words cut like barbed wire
Every kiss tosses water on the fire
And I don’t wanna live like this
On opposite sides of fences

I’m reaching for you through the wire
All we gotta do is try
